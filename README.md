# Netflix-data-analysis

I conducted an in-depth analysis of Netflix data, focusing on user preferences, content popularity, and release trends. Key findings include identifying the most liked content categories (movies vs. TV shows), analyzing release patterns over years, and using statistical methods for insights. The project showcased my skills in data analysis, Python programming, statistical analysis, and data visualization.
